# Agenda

## Agenda

* Recap: annotations
* ButterKnife
* Android Annotations

## Recap: Annotations - 1 - Example: Declaration

```java
// accessiblity of annotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
// this annotation is only applicable to...
@Target(ElementType.FIELD)
// the actual annotation definition
public interface @MyAnnotation {
  // annotation parameter definition
  int someParameter() default 0;
}
```
## Recap Annotations - 2 - Example Explained

* Retention (can be left out):
    * SOURCE: annotation only available in source code (e.g.: compile time checks)
    * CLASS: default, available in class file and source code (e.g.: compile time checks in external lib)
    * RUNTIME: available at runtime, in class file and source code (everything that requires runtime checks)
* Target
   * Defines what kind of construct can be annotated using this annotation (can be left out)
   * Can be a number of things including: FIELD, METHOD and TYPE

## Recap Annotations - 3 - Example: Usage

```java
@MyAnnotation(1)
private Object testField;
```

## Recap Annotations - 4 - Example: Accessing Runtime Annotations

```java
MyAnnotation a = (MyAnnotation) myObject
  .getClass()
  .getDeclaredField("testField")
  .getAnnotation(MyAnnotation.class);		   
// getting our value!
a.testField();
```

## Butter Knife - 1 - Intro

* Butter Knife could be described as a micro framework
* It does two things (and does them well):
    * Resource Injection
    * Listener Bindings
* Uses code generation, older versions rely on reflections
* If you want something more sophisticated and less focused, AndroidAnnotations / Dagger 2 might be more to your liking

## Butter Knife - 2 - Supported Annotations

* Butter Knife supports the following Annotations:
    * @BindView: allows view bindings
    * @Bind[Drawable,Bool,Color,Dimen,Int,String]: binds resource type
    * @OnClick: mark method as click listener for specified button

## Butter Knife - 3 - Mechanism

* ButterKnife generates glue code for you.
* In order to make Butter Knife aware of the annotations, we need to manually bind Butter Knife to the component in question, likewise, we need to unbind Butter Knife when we are done (Fragments)
    * By calling `bind`, you are delegating the binding process to the code generated by ButterKnife
* Use: ButterKnife.bind(targetClass), ButterKnife.unbind(targetClass), Butter Knife also supports providing Activities, Dialogs and Views as secondary parameters, which is important if we want to bind views of Fragments!
* Please note that fields, which we want to inject using Butter Knife must not be `private`

```java
public void bind(ExampleActivity activity) {
  activity.subtitle = 
    (android.widget.TextView) activity.findViewById(2130968578);
  activity.footer = 
    (android.widget.TextView) activity.findViewById(2130968579);
  activity.title = 
    (android.widget.TextView) activity.findViewById(2130968577);
}
```

# AndroidAnnotations

## AndroidAnnotations - 1 - Introduction

* AndroidAnnotations support a number of different features, including view injection and listener binding!
* Not as focused as Butter Knife:
    * Supports "real" dependency injection and resource injection
    * Supports event binding
    * Thread binding
    * REST API binding
    * Android Preference API helpers / typesafty

## AndroidAnnotations - 2 - Introduction cont.

* Since AndroidAnnotations is a very large framework, we will not cover everything here
* We will only cover view injection and event binding
* Unlike other Android frameworks, AndroidAnnotations is well documented
* Uses code generation
* See these resources for more information on the topic [here](https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations/wiki/AvailableAnnotations)

## AndroidAnnotations - 3 - Introduction cont.

* Unlike Butter Knife, which needs to be bound manually, AndroidAnnotations will generate code from annotated classes
* That also means that we need to be careful when calling our components in Java code or XML.
    * Our Activity / Fragment / Service / ContentProvider / etc is not the one that will be used during runtime, we need to reference the actual component by denoting (postfixing) it with an "\_", MainActivity.class becomes MainActivity\_.class, even in AndroidManifest.xml declaration!
* Generated files can be found in build/generated/source/apt/debug

## AndroidAnnotations - 4 - Injection

* AndroidAnnotations features a set of annotations to make the framework recognize these classes as annotated (Enhanced Components)
* Please note that fields, which we want to inject using AndroidAnnotations must not be `private`

## AndroidAnnotations - 5 - Annotations

* We will cover all annotations that allow us to mimic the behavior of Butter Knife:
    * @ViewById: corresponds to @BindView
    * @Click: corresponds to @OnClick
    * @[]Res: Corresponds to @Bind[]
